## Team members (Foodies):

+ Huang, He
+ Liu, Ye
+ Sun, Lichao
+ Wang, Zhu
+ Xia, Congying
+ Zhu, Fan

We are using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking) Kaggle Competition as our project topic.


## Important Deadlines:


	Mar 16, proposal due 	
	Apr 4, progress report due 	
	Apr 25: presentations
	Apr 27, presentations, final report due 


## Problem definition: 
	1.Text Classificationï¼š
		1) Features: all V ingredients, and each recipe is represented as a vector of length V.
		2) Classes: all K kinds of cuisines 

## ML Algorithms: 
	1. SVM (multiple classes version)
	2. Random Forest
	3. Naive Bayes
	4. Class-baed Association Rule Mining
	5. Neural Network
	6. Latent Dirichlet Allocation

## Visualization: 
	1.reduce V-dimensional vectors to 2- or 3- dimensional vectors
	2. Methods:
		1) PCA
		2) t-SNE		
		
[t-SNE example](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/an-illustrated-introduction-to-the-t-sne-algorithm)

## Contributions:
	1. Using many traditional ML techniques
	2. Compare the performance of each used technique
	3. Visualizing the recipes in 2-D/3-D space to show the closeness of recipes.
