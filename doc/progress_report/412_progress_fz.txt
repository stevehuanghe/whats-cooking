1. What we have done

-Naive Bayes:
1.1
we use MultinomialNB from sklearn.naive_bayes to build Naive Bayes classifiers. MultinomialNB is suitable for word counts to do text classification.
When we set additive (Laplace/Lidstone) smoothing parameter alpha equals 1.0, the accuracy is 72.94% evaluated by 5-fold cross validation.
We also try Tf–idf term weighting to exact text features, while the accuracy decrease to 65.07%.
1.2
We use BernoulliNB from sklearn.naive_bayes to build Naive Bayes classifiers. The difference is that while MultinomialNB works with occurrence counts, BernoulliNB is designed for binary/boolean features.
The accuracy is 69.48% by the default setting.

2. What to be done
- Naive Bayes:

Tune the parameters of MultinomialNB to get higher accuracy.
