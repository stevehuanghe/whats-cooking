1. What we have done

- Random Forest:
we transforme the data in joson format into matrix (using one-hot encoding) and use RandomForestClassifier kit in python sklearn to build random forest classifiers. Since it's a multi-classify problem, we choosed the OneVsRestClassifier to build multi-class classifiers. 

The test accuracy is 72.375%.

2. What to be done

- Overall
(a) We can use ensemble method like bagging and boosting in each method to improve the accuracy.
(b) We can use the voting result of different methods that we use.

- Random Forest
(a) We can use TF-IDF and other method to make feature selection before we build the classifer.
(b) We can adjust parameters in random forest like the max_depth of the tree, the numbers of the trees in forest to improve the accuracy.
